Trying out Puppeteer by writing a script that goes to Facebook activity log and delete everything.

# Setting up

Need node >= 7 since we're using `await`.

```bash
yarn install
node fuckoff.js
```

Screenshots of some tests are saved in `./screenshots/`. Could be helpful for debugging when things
go wrong.
